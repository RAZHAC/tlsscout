# tlsscout
tlsscout is a django implementation of the ssllabs website scanner API. 
You can run tlsscout on your own server to check your websites periodically, 
with alerting when something changes.

# Installation
See requirements.txt for a list of packages used by tlsscout. You will also need something
to serve the application. I prefer uwsgi behind an nginx server. YMMV.
